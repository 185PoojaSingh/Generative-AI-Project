# Generative-AI-Project
This Gradio app lets users upload PDFs and query their content using OpenAI's language models. Users can set/change the API key, upload a PDF, and ask questions. The app processes the PDF, retrieves relevant sections, and generates responses. It also renders specific PDF pages as images, providing an interactive way to explore documents.
